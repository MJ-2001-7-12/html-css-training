Code that I've worked on for HTML and CSS training.

## Description
During my Initial Learning Program (ILP), I received training in HTML and CSS. 
As part of this training, I designed the homepage for the GG Hospital website. 

I finished the project in Visual Studio Code, deploying the HTML on a local server with the Live Server extension and 
also maintained consistent code formatting using the Prettier extension.

## Locations
In the development branch of the HTML-CSS training repository, you'll find the GGHospital folder, which holds the finished task. 
Inside, you can locate:
1) Home.html
2) ggcss.css
3) pics folder
4) navbar folder with one image and a nav.css file.

## Content Included
The page has the following contents included:

1) Navigation Bar
2) Book Appointment
3) Departments Listed
4) Why GG is better section
5) Specialists
6) Facilities and Activities
7) You May Be Interested In section
8) Newsletter
9) Footer
